# NSStringTransformExample


This is an example of how we can use string transformations which, prior to iOS 9, were in Core Foundation. Brought to my attention by [NSHipster's post on iOS9](http://nshipster.com/ios9/).

The project uses NSStringTransform constant, ```NSStringTransformToUnicodeName```, to print the name of the Emoji character in the input text field.
